# Economics Concepts and Principles by Gabay: A Comprehensive Textbook for Students
 
Economics is a social science that studies how people make choices under scarcity. It deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, as well as the behavior and interactions of economic agents. Economics can be divided into two main branches: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics focuses on the decisions of individuals and firms, while macroeconomics analyzes the performance and policies of the economy as a whole.
